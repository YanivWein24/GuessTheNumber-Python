There are 3 versions for this game:

In the first 2 versions, the player needs to guess the number that was picked by the PC.
These versions are very similar to each other, but each of them is using different approach
to do the same thing.

In the 3rd version, the user gets to choose the number, and the PC needs to figure out this number.
With this version, the PC is using the "Binary Search" algorithm in order to find the correct number in a 
in a fast and efficient way (decreasing time complexity to O(log n) ).
